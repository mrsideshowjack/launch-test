Access to funding is one of the major hurdles on the road to developing and deploying innovative new products and services to market.

Launch seeks to utilise the latest developments in open data, big data analysis, and intelligent information matching systems, in order to assist our partners in identifying funding sources for their innovation projects.

Thousands of funding opportunities targeted at SME companies are released in the UK every year. Our Launch Funding portal integrates publicly available information, on both companies and funding resources, to provide tailored funding matches for your business.

Launch International assists SMEs and startups to locate and apply for funding from a variety of different public sources. We have developed a large dataset about funding information across the UK, as well as EU funding available to companies in the UK. This dataset is manually collected and curated from funding bodies such as Innovate UK, Horizon 2020, RCUK etc.

Our funding identification tool is free to use â€“ just click the button below to start your search.
